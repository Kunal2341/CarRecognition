# CarRecognition
-   Color
	- Using Numpy Array, I will take the color of the pixel and using average get the color of the car
-   Logo
	-   I will have to look into a dataset but that will be simple
-   License plate
	- [https://github.com/Dharun/Tensorflow-License-Plate-Detection](https://github.com/Dharun/Tensorflow-License-Plate-Detection)
	-  [License Plate Recognition API](https://app.platerecognizer.com/accounts/login/?next=/) (API)
	- Using tesseract to detect text on the license plate
-   Make, Model, Year of Car
	- Using the Stanford dataset I will be able to detect this
